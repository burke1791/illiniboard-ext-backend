He only played in one game last season: the bowl game. But because the staff only releases "notable" injuries (an hour before each game), we don't really know if he was injured all season or if he was just buried on the depth chart. For the final game - correction, an hour before the final game - we finally got a list of all the injuries: [[twitter https://twitter.com/IlliniStats/status/1200806013257080833?s=20]] That's the first time we</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://illiniboard.com/story/2020/7/2/the-90-illini-72-carlos-sandy</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:25:16 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>The 90 Illini #73: Nick Fedanzo</title><link>https://illiniboard.com/story/2020/7/1/the-90-illini-73-nick-fedanzo</link><description>There were six intentional redshirts last season. "Intentional" meaning the coaches took advantage of the new rule (new as of 2018) where players who participate in four-or-less games can still redshirt. Evan Kirts and Josh Plohr didn't get on the field at all so their redshirts were more of the "wasn't going to play anyway" variety (freshman offensive linemen needing to get bigger). Six guys played but were then shut down after either three or four games (three, in my opinion, because the coaches</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://illiniboard.com/story/2020/7/1/the-90-illini-73-nick-fedanzo</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 18:09:42 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Tracking Tom Cruises</title><link>https://illiniboard.com/story/2020/6/30/tracking-tom-cruises</link><description>Let's just get this out of the way.
